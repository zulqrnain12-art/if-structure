Project Description:
Are you passionate about the beauty of nature and the power of technology?
Join us in our exciting project, "Flower Recognition using Machine Learning," where we leverage 
cutting-edge artificial intelligence to identify and appreciate the diverse world of flowers.

Project Overview:
Flowers captivate us with their vibrant colors, intricate shapes, and unique characteristics. 
However, recognizing and identifying these floral wonders can be a challenge, especially for those not
well-versed in botany. This is where our project steps in. We aim to develop a state-of-the-art machine 
learning model capable of recognizing a wide variety of flowers accurately and efficiently.
